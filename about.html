      <h3 id="about-us">Our Story:</h3>
      <p>Straight to the Point Archery is a non profit archery education center founded in 2005 by Giap Nguyen. Our state of the art educational and training facility incorporates detailed technical video analysis combined with generations of archery
        experience from certified coaches and instructors.</p>
      <p>Giap Nguyen started Straight to the Point Archery in 2005. He's an avid and accomplished archer himself, having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics. He has three children, and started Straight to the
        Point in part because he was not satisfied with the archery eduction options for them in Tacoma. After The Hunger Games books and movies came out, he noticed a surge in popularity of archery among young people, especially young women, and the
        business has been booming ever since.</p>
